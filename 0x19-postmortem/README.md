## Issue Summary:

- **Duration:** February 22, 2024, 9:00 PM - February 23, 2024, 1:00 AM (UTC)
- **Impact:** Our web app took a siesta, resulting in users seeing more spinners than a Las Vegas casino. Approximately 30% of our users were stranded in digital limbo, experiencing delays and errors akin to a GPS taking them down a dead-end road.
- **Root Cause:** Turns out, our database connection pooling settings decided to go rogue, hogging resources like a kid with a plate of cookies at a birthday party, leaving the database unresponsive and our app in the digital doghouse.

## Timeline:

- **9:00 PM:** Monitoring alerts hit us like a ton of bricks, signaling trouble in paradise.
- **9:15 PM:** Engineers were alerted, realizing something was as wonky as a three-dollar bill.
- **9:30 PM:** We first suspected gremlins in the front-end servers, but they were just innocent bystanders.
- **10:00 PM:** With no luck in frontend land, we ventured into the backend wilderness, hoping for answers.
- **11:00 PM:** Database connection pooling settings caught our eye like a sore thumb, smelling fishier than a day-old tuna sandwich.
- **11:30 PM:** We finally unraveled the mystery, discovering the misconfigured settings playing puppet master with our database.
- **12:00 AM:** Senior engineers were called in like the cavalry, wielding their expertise like digital Excaliburs.
- **1:00 AM:** With the root cause in our sights, we set sail on the sea of solutions.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

- **Root Cause:** The misconfigured database connection pooling settings acted like a kid in a candy store, gobbling up resources and leaving none for the database, resulting in a digital traffic jam.
- **Resolution:** We cracked the whip on those unruly settings, tuning them to behave like well-mannered citizens. Additionally, we deployed a watchdog script to bark at any future misconfigurations before they could wreak havoc.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Regularly review and fine-tune database connection pooling settings to keep them in line.
  - Beef up monitoring capabilities to catch misbehaving settings before they throw a digital tantrum.
- **Tasks:**
  - Tweak database connection pooling configurations to keep them from going rogue again.
  - Implement automated monitoring to keep an eye on those sneaky settings.
  - Conduct a thorough system configuration review to sniff out any other troublemakers.
  - Update our incident response playbook to streamline our response like a well-oiled machine.

## Conclusion:

So there you have it, folks! Our little adventure through the digital jungle taught us a valuable lesson: even the smallest misconfiguration can cause chaos in our digital paradise. But fear not, for we've emerged stronger and wiser, armed with the knowledge and tools to fend off any gremlins that dare cross our path. Until next time, stay vigilant, stay curious, and may your databases always be well-behaved!
